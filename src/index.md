Hi. I'm Pete Lambert and amongst a fair few other things, I'm a husband, father, design engineer and musician from Yorkshire.

**I like the web**. Iâ€™ve been designing and building for it since 1999. Iâ€™ve lived through the browser wars and the dot-com crash. I love doing what I do. Itâ€™s a great thing, being a veteran in whatâ€™s still a nascent industry.

Since 2010 Iâ€™ve been working for [Logikcull](https://logikcull.com) as a Designer and UX/UI Engineer (front of the front end). Itâ€™s a fantastic company made of fantastic people, and it gets me out of the house and over to the US every so often. It's a varied role that takes in UI design, leadership, engineering (HTML, CSS, JS, React, etc.), product work, and a lot of hands on customer research.

[I'm a musician](https://petelambertmusic.com), writing and recording music (currently working on my debut album), and I perform around the UK. From 2020 to 2023 I ran [Lockdown Open Mic](https://lockdownopenmic.club), a virtual open mic night for the Covid generation.

I love a bit of snowboarding but getting to mountains is tricky and I've got a bunch of bikes that I don't use enough. I pick up new hobbies and passions pretty easily and pretty frequently. If Iâ€™m given the opportunity to try something new Iâ€™ll usually take it.

I live in [York](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/York), in the North of England with my beautiful wife and our awesome son.

If you want to get in touch, <a rel="me" href="mailto:pete@petelambert.com">drop me an email</a> (because email sticks around - I'm too flighty with social media platforms these days).

* [Limitations of HTML Email Templates in MailChimp - Designmodo](https://designmodo.com/mailchimp-limitations-email/) - I’ve had call to work on some HTML email templates recently and whilst it’s nowhere near as bad as it used to be, it’s still a pain in the arse.

This makes things like Superhuman off limits to me and it looks like I’m making the right choice. In some companies, it seems ethics in software design is in the bin.

* [Uibot -- Infinite UI designs](https://www.uibot.app/) - This is brilliant. An app that randomly, programatically produces app UIs. 
* [Self-Host Your Static Assets – CSS Wizardry – CSS Architecture, Web Performance Optimisation, and more, by Harry Roberts](https://csswizardry.com/2019/05/self-host-your-static-assets/)
* [What’s in my 2019 WWDC Travel Bag – The Sweet Setup](https://thesweetsetup.com/whats-in-my-2019-wwdc-travel-bag/) - I’m not going to WWDC but it doesn’t matter. I love these kinds of blog posts. Travel blogs, tech blogs, whatever. Just tell me what’s in your bag and I’ll lap it up.
* [Building the most inaccessible site possible with a perfect Lighthouse score - Manuel Matuzović](https://www.matuzo.at/blog/building-the-most-inaccessible-site-possible-with-a-perfect-lighthouse-score/) - A fun and important demonstration of why a ‘pass’  in your automated accessibility testing suite does not and accessible site make.  
* [Data Tables](http://inclusive-components.design/data-tables/) - A detailed article on building inclusive data tables. I think I’ll be purchasing the book too. [Inclusive Components – Heydon Pickering](http://book.inclusive-components.design)
* [Everything Apple Announced at WWDC 2019 in Nine Minutes - MacRumors](https://www.macrumors.com/2019/06/03/everything-apple-announced-at-wwdc/) - I’m especially excited about Catalyst, and how potentially easy it will be for developers of my favourite iOS apps to create versions for the Mac. I wonder what it will mean for apps that already have a Mac counterpart (like Twitterrific). With only one codebase to maintain we could see some amazing developments.
* [How Frontend Developers Can Help To Bridge The Gap Between Designers And Developers -- Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2019/05/frontend-developers-designers/) - As a Frontend Developer, I’ve always felt that a really important part of the role is the act as a conduit between design and those developers deeper in the stack. This is a great read about how we can all help each other at every step of the process.
* [Web Maker](https://webmaker.app/) - This is interesting. An offline, browser-based CodePen-like web playground.
* [An Introduction to ARIA States | a11y with Lindsey](https://www.a11ywithlindsey.com/blog/introduction-aria-states/) - Attributes to help communicate the state of components in your app.
* [The View From Above (Paid Post by Allbirds from The New York Times)](https://www.nytimes.com/paidpost/allbirds/the-view-from-above.html) - This is a beautiful use of depth, colour, sound and motion in web design. I’d love to build something like this (and I might just).

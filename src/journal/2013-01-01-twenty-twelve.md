I've been thinking back on the year. What an amazing 12 months it's been for me.





This year I've celebrated my 10th wedding anniversary with my beautiful wife and become an uncle for the first time.





I've made new friends and had great times with old ones. My business has been successful and I've worked harder than at any other time in my life.





Despite this I've carved out more time to spend with my wonderful son, helping out at after-school clubs and on school trips.





I've lost over 6 stone in weight and I'm now lighter than I've been since I was about 14 years old (I was a heavy kid). I'm fitter than I've ever been in my life. I have an actual six pack. I've ridden 2000 miles on my bike this year.





I'd like to thank everyone who's cheered me on this year. Obviously Nicki and Miles but also everyone who supported me online and in person in what's been a life-changing year for me. Your kind words, Likes, comments and general cheerleading have made a big difference and I really appreciate it.





2013 has a lot to live up to but I'm really excited to see what more I can achieve in the next 12 months.





Cheers.

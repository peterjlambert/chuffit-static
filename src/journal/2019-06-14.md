* [Adam Wathan on Twitter](https://twitter.com/adamwathan/status/1138916993933938689) looked at another of Netlify’s great features: "I love how simple tools can be when you don't have to accommodate non-technical users. For example, check out [@Netlify](https://twitter.com/netlify)’s split-testing feature -- is it some complex `contenteditable` WYSIWYG interface? Nope, just specify two Git branches to split-test, done. [Link](https://t.co/EPq6BWZaEp)"
* [Drawing Realistic Clouds with SVG and CSS | CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/drawing-realistic-clouds-with-svg-and-css/) - This is fantastic. I don’t get to build things like this in my day-to-day. I really need to make more of an effort to get involved in these creative exercises in my down time.
